Image classification using SVM
Image classification is a task of categorizing images into pre-defined classes or categories. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms used for image classification. SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems.

In image classification using SVM, the first step is to extract features from the images. Features can be extracted using various techniques such as SIFT, SURF, and HOG. These features are then used to train the SVM classifier. The SVM classifier tries to find a hyperplane that can separate the different classes in the feature space.

During the training phase, the SVM classifier learns from the training data and tries to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the different classes. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest points from each class. The SVM classifier aims to maximize the margin so that it can classify the test data with high accuracy.

Once the SVM classifier is trained, it can be used to classify new images. The new images are first preprocessed to extract features, and then the SVM classifier is used to predict the class of the image.

Overall, image classification using SVM is a popular approach for categorizing images into pre-defined classes. SVM provides high accuracy and is robust to noise and outliers. However, feature extraction can be a time-consuming task, and SVM may not perform well if the dataset is imbalanced or if there are too many classes.
